#Modification1 --> lib/common/widgets/texts/h_brand_title_text_with_verified_icon.dart

-- On max, they all aligned to the left side of the card.


#Modification2 --> lib/features/shop/screens/store/store.dart
-- Changed the expanded height from 440 to 410
-- The change will be reflected in the Store section
-- The change will be exactly on the tabbar -sports, furniture....

#Modification3 --> lib/features/shop/screens/product_details/widgets/product_meta_data.dart
-- In this file, in video 22, he has simply written Text, whereas for the price the widget was already created in file:
   --> lib/common/widgets/texts/product_price_text.dart
-- I have used the HProductPrice widget and applied that instead of Text


#Modification4 --> lib/common/widgets/texts/h_brand_title_text_with_verified_icon.dart
-- Removed the HBrandTitleText from the flexible widget
-- If any problem persists in any part of the code, wrap the HBrandTitleText with Flexible widget

#Modification5 --> lib/features/authentication/screens/signup/widgets/terms_conditions_check.dart
-- Wrapped the Text.rich with Expanded widget to stop renderflex issues on the signup screen

#Modification6 --> lib/features/personalization/screens/settings/settings.dart
-- Modified the logout button onpressed to call the logout function of the authentication repository
-- According to the functionality it is correct but verification needed at the end.

#Modification7 --> lib/features/authentication/controllers/login/login_controller.dart
-- In video 37, the code to be added in onInit function is
   --> email.text = localStorage.read('REMEMBER_ME_EMAIL');
   --> password.text = localStorage.read('REMEMBER_ME_PASSWORD');
-- But the above code gave error of null string. The code expects a string value but it gets null if the email and pass is not saved on the local storage
-- So adding a null check ?? ' ' will ensure that if the user has not stored the email and pass using the remember me option then it will not throw any error on the screen
